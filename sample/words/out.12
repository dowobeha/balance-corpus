Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law,
No one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms.
2. Everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work.
Nothing in this Declaration may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein.
