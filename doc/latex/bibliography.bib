  Abstract =	 {The concept of maximum entropy can be traced back
                  along multiple threads to Biblical times. Only
                  recently, however, have computers become powerful
                  enough to permit the widescale application of this
                  concept to real world problems in statistical
                  estimation and pattern recognition. In this paper,
                  we describe a method for statistical modeling based
                  on maximum entropy. We present a maximum-likelihood
                  approach for automatically constructing maximum
                  entropy models and describe how to implement this
                  approach efficiently, using as examples several
                  problems in natural language processing.}

  Abstract =	 {This paper describes advances in the use of
                  confusion networks as interface between automatic
                  speech recognition and machine translation. In
                  particular, it presents an implementation of a
                  confusion network decoder which significantly
                  improves both in efficiency and performance previous
                  work along this direction. The confusion network
                  decoder results as an extension of a
                  state-of-the-art phrase-based text translation
                  system. Experimental results in terms of decoding
                  speed and translation accuracy are reported on a
                  real-data task, namely the translation of Plenary
                  Speeches at the European Parliament from Spanish to
                  English.}

                  algorithms for assigning words to classes based on
                  the frequency of their co-occurrence with other
                  words. We find that we are able to extract classes
                  that have the flavor of either syntactically based
                  groupings or semantically based groupings, depending
                  on the nature of the underlying statistics.}

  Abstract =	 {We describe a series of five statistical models of
                  the translation process and give algorithms for
                  estimating the parameters of these models given a
                  set of pairs of sentences that are translations of
                  one another. We define a concept of word-by-word
                  alignment between such pairs of sentences. For any
                  given pair of such sentences each of our models
                  assigns a probability to each of the possible
                  word-by-word alignments. We give an algorithm for
                  seeking the most probable of these
                  alignments. Although the algorithm is suboptimal,
                  the alignment thus obtained accounts well for the
                  word-by-word relationships in the pair of
                  sentences. We have a great deal of data in French
                  and English from the proceedings of the Canadian
                  Parliament. Accordingly, we have restricted our work
                  to these two languages; but we feel that because our
                  algorithms have minimal linguistic content they
                  would work well on other pairs of languages. We also
                  feel, again because of the minimal linguistic
                  content of our algorithms, that it is reasonable to
                  argue that word-by-word alignments are inherent in
                  any sufficiently large bilingual corpus.}

  Abstract =	 {This paper presents a new paradigm for translation
                  from inflectionally rich languages that was used in
                  the University of Maryland statistical machine
                  translation system for the WMT07 Shared Task. The
                  system is based on a hierarchical phrase-based
                  decoder that has been augmented to translate
                  ambiguous input given in the form of a confusion
                  network (CN), a weighted finite state representation
                  of a set of strings. By treating morphologically
                  derived forms of the input sequence as possible,
                  albeit more ``costly'' paths that the decoder may
                  select, we find that significant gains (10% BLEU
                  relative) can be attained when translating from
                  Czech, a language with considerable inflectional
                  complexity, into English.}

                  language translation; we argue that it provides a
                  compelling model for translation of text genres, as
                  well. We show that prior work in translating
                  lattices using finite state techniques can be
                  naturally extended to more expressive synchronous
                  context-free grammar-based models. Additionally, we
                  resolve a significant complication that non-linear
                  word lattice inputs introduce in reordering
                  models. Our experiments evaluating the approach
                  demonstrate substantial gains for Chinese-English
                  and Arabic-English translation.}

  Abstract =	 {Statistical MT has made great progress in the last
                  few years, but current translation models are weak
                  on re-ordering and target language
                  fluency. Syntactic approaches seek to remedy these
                  problems. In this paper, we take the framework for
                  acquiring multi-level syntactic translation rules of
                  (Galley et al., 2004) from aligned tree-string
                  pairs, and present two main extensions of their
                  approach: first, instead of merely computing a
                  single derivation that minimally explains a sentence
                  pair, we construct a large number of derivations
                  that include contextually richer rules, and account
                  for multiple interpretations of unaligned
                  words. Second, we propose probability estimates and
                  a training procedure for weighting these rules. We
                  contrast different approaches on real examples, show
                  that our estimates based on multiple derivations
                  favor phrasal re-orderings that are linguistically
                  better motivated, and establish that our larger
                  rules provide a 3.63 BLEU point increase over
                  minimal rules.}

  Abstract =	 {We propose a new phrase-based translation model and
                  decoding algorithm that enables us to evaluate and
                  compare several, previously proposed phrase-based
                  translation models. Within our framework, we carry
                  out a large number of experiments to understand
                  better and explain why phrase-based models
                  outperform word-based models. Our empirical results,
                  which hold for all examined language pairs, suggest
                  that the highest levels of performance can be
                  obtained through relatively simple means: heuristic
                  learning of phrase translations from word-based
                  alignments and lexical weighting of phrase
                  translations. Surprisingly, learning phrases longer
                  than three words and learning phrases from
                  high-accuracy word-level alignment models does not
                  have a strong impact on performance. Learning only
                  syntactically motivated phrases degrades the
                  performance of our systems.}

  Abstract =	 {Often, the training procedure for statistical
                  machine translation models is based on maximum
                  likelihood or related criteria. A general problem of
                  this approach is that there is only a loose relation
                  to the final translation quality on unseen text. In
                  this paper, we analyze various training criteria
                  which directly optimize translation quality. These
                  training criteria make use of recently proposed
                  automatic evaluation metrics. We describe a new
                  algorithm for efficient training an unsmoothed error
                  count. We show that significantly better results can
                  often be obtained if the final evaluation criteria
                  is taken directly into account as part of the
                  training procedure.}

  Abstract =	 {We describe methods for translating a text given in
                  multiple source languages into a single target
                  language. The goal is to improve translation quality
                  in applications where the ultimate goal is to
                  translate the same document into many languages. We
                  describe a statistical approach and two specific
                  statistical models to deal with this problem. Our
                  method is generally applicable as it is independent
                  of specific models, languages or application
                  domains. We evaluate the approach on a multilingual
                  corpus covering all eleven official European Union
                  languages that was collected automatically from the
                  Internet. In various tests we show that these
                  methods can significantly improve translation
                  quality. As a side effect, we also compare the
                  quality of statistical machine translation systems
                  for many European languages in the same domain.},
  Annote =	 {This work proposes two techniques for selecting the

                  systems when translating the same sentence from
                  multiple source languages. The first technique, MAX,
                  chooses the system output with the maximum p( f | e)
                  * p( e ). The second technique, PROD, multiplies the

                  maximum entropy models, which contains the widely
                  used source-channel approach as a special case. All
                  knowledge sources are treated as feature functions,
                  which depend on the source language sentence, the
                  target language sentence and possible hidden
                  variables. This approach allows a baseline machine
                  translation system to be extended easily by adding
                  new feature functions. We show that a baseline
                  statistical machine translation system is
                  significantly improved using this approach.}

  Abstract =	 {A phrase-based statistical machine translation
                  approach --- the alignment template approach --- is
                  described. This translation approach allows for
                  general many-to-many relations between
                  words. Thereby, the context of words is taken into
                  account in the translation model, and local changes
                  in word order from source to target language can be
                  learned explicitly. The model is described using a
                  log-linear modeling approach, which is a
                  generalization of the often used source--channel
                  approach. Thereby, the model is easier to extend
                  than classical statistical machine translation
                  systems. We describe in detail the process for
                  learning phrasal translations, the feature functions
                  used, and the search algorithm. The evaluation of
                  this approach is performed on three different
                  tasks. For the German--English speech Verbmobil
                  task, we analyze the effect of various sys- tem
                  components. On the French--English Canadian Hansards
                  task, the alignment template system obtains
                  significantly better results than a
                  single-word-based translation model. In the
                  Chinese--English 2002 National Institute of
                  Standards and Technology (NIST) machine transla-
                  tion evaluation it yields statistically
                  significantly better NIST scores than all competing
                  research and commercial translation systems.}

  Abstract =	 {We introduce a stochastic grammatical channel model
                  for machine translation, that synthesizes several
                  desirable characteristics of both statistical and
                  grammatical machine translation. As with the pure
                  statistical translation model described by Wu (1996)
                  (in which a bracketing transduction grammar models
                  the channel), alternative hypotheses compete
                  probabilistically, exhaustive search of the
                  translation hypothesis space can be performed in
                  polynomial time, and robustness heuristics arise
                  naturally from a language-independent
                  inversiontransduction model. However, unlike pure
                  statistical translation models, the generated output
                  string is guaranteed to conform to a given target
                  grammar. The model employs only (1) a translation
                  lexicon, (2) a context-free grammar for the target
                  language, and (3) a bigram language model. The fact
                  that no explicit bilingual translation rules are
                  used makes the model easily portable to a variety of
                  source languages. Initial experiments show that it
                  also achieves significant speed gains over our
                  earlier model.}

                  and case marking. Model parameters are estimated in
                  polynomial time using an EM algorithm. The model
